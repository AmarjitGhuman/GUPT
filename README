GUPT is a privacy preserving data mining platform. GUPT guarantees
privacy in statistical databases using Differential Privacy. In order
to use arbitrary binaries, for your computation, you will need to
invoke your binary from the GuptComputeProvider object, and possibly
pipe IO through some form of IPC mechanism.
